# Dicoding Kotlin Starter

This repository contains my learning progress in Kotlin programming through a course offered by Dicoding.

## Description

This repository includes various materials and code samples I created while attending the **Learn Kotlin Programming** class on Dicoding. This project helps me understand Kotlin fundamentals, syntax, and the implementation of programming concepts like functions, classes, objects, and the use of collections and control flow.

## Features

- Basic Kotlin syntax examples.
- Exercises on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- Usage of collections and lambda functions in Kotlin.
- Examples of exception handling and null safety.
- A simple project to apply the concepts learned.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tamathecxder/dicoding-kotlin-starter.git
   
2. Open the project in a Kotlin-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio is recommended).

3. Run the sample code in the src directory to explore various Kotlin features covered in the course.

## Topics Covered
* Kotlin Basics: Variables, data types, and operators.
* Functions and Lambdas: How to define functions and use lambda expressions.
* OOP in Kotlin: Classes, objects, inheritance, and interfaces.
* Collections and Data Processing: Lists, Sets, Maps, and operations like filter, map, and reduce.
* Null Safety: Kotlinâ€™s way of handling nulls to avoid NullPointerException.
* Exception Handling: Handling errors using try-catch blocks.
